Building out [Ryan Gantz](https://twitter.com/sixfoot6)'s [idea](https://twitter.com/sixfoot6/status/630825211370143744) for a Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'you guys' with 'you babies'

Why change 'you guys' with 'you babies'? Check out these articles: 
- [This is npm's "Guys jar"](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/120475872425/this-is-npms-guys-jar-we-didnt-invent-the) (The npm Blog)
- [Why I'm finally convinced it's time to stop saying "you guys"](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8761227/you-guys-sexism-language) (Vox.com)

"You can think of the push to drop "guys" as political correctness run amok, or you can think of it as making a tiny change that doesn't cost you anything and will keep you from being a jerk to half the population â€” and help you make the world just a tiny bit more fair." - [Jenee Desmond-Harris](https://twitter.com/jdesmondharris)
